# moving-vehicle-in-C
This is a simple program in C language using Graphics to move a vehicle with two(forward and backward) controls.


ABOUT THE PROJECT
In this very project we have considered a scenario of a man - who is stopping a moving vehicle – standing near a STOP marking pole. Again we can see a man standing in the vehicle near its door. Also we can control the vehicle by using the keyboard keys (namely A and D), as well as it generates the vehicle’s engine sound while covering the distance across the road and generates horn sound when it reaches near to the end of the road that should be travelled by the vehicle. 
The main logic of the program is based on the concept of TRANSLATION. The translation distance is changed frequently by using a loop control structure and thereby maintaining the position of the vehicle on the screen. The smooth animation of the moving objects are achieved by using the delay () function defined inside the DOS.h header file. For generating the horn sound with different frequencies and for checking the input given by the user - to move the vehicle either forward or backward – the conditional control structures are applied.
The comprehensive use of conditional control structures, loop control structures, built-in functions (provided by the software packages), user defined functions and translation concepts generates the overall scenario.
